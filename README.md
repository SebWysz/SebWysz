- Hello, I’m @SebWysz
- I’m interested in machine learning and its processes.
- I’m currently learning from the Machine learning course on coursera.
- I’m looking to collaborate on an early machine learning project that my abilities can fit into, considering I am new to programming.
- If you would like to contact me, you can email me at wyszynskiseb@gmail.com.
